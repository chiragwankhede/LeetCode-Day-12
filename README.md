🌟 Day 12: LeetCode Array Manipulation 🚀

Hey everyone! 👋 I’m excited to share my progress from Day 12 of the 50 Days LeetCode Milestone Challenge. Today, I tackled two intriguing problems focused on array manipulation. Here’s a breakdown of what I worked on:

Contents:
1. Build Array from Permutation (Q1920)
   - Problem Statement: Given a zero-based permutation `nums`, the task is to build an array `ans` where `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Approach: I directly accessed elements using their indices, which allowed me to construct the permutation array efficiently.
   - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳

2. Shuffle the Array (Q1470)
   - Problem Statement: Given an array `nums` consisting of 2n elements, the goal is to return the array in the form `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]`.
   - Approach: I created a new array by iterating through the first and second halves of the original array simultaneously, effectively shuffling the elements.
   - Time Complexity: O(n) ⏳

Why This Matters:
Array manipulation is a fundamental skill in coding, and these problems provide great practice for efficiently handling arrays in various scenarios. Mastery of these techniques is essential for tackling more complex data structure challenges.

Repository Structure:
- `build_array_from_permutation.cpp`: Contains the implementation for building an array from a permutation.
- `shuffle_the_array.cpp`: Includes the code to shuffle the array based on the problem constraints.
- `README.md`: This readme file provides an overview of the problems, approaches, and solutions.

How to Use:
- Explore the code examples to gain insights into array manipulation techniques.
- Use these examples as a reference for solving similar problems in your own projects or during competitive programming sessions.
